# Bash commands
- npm run dev:full: Start the development environment and run in the background
- npm test: Run unit tests with Vitest
- npm run test:run: Run tests once and exit

# Core Development Philosophy

## Important Notes

- **NEVER ASSUME OR GUESS** - When in doubt, ask for clarification
- **Always verify file paths and module names** before use
- **Keep CLAUDE.md updated** when adding new patterns or dependencies
- **Test your code** - No feature is complete without tests
- **Document your decisions** - Future developers (including yourself) will thank you

## Code style
- Use ES modules (import/export) syntax, not CommonJS (require)
- Destructure imports when possible (eg. import { foo } from 'bar')

## Workflow
- Be sure to typecheck when youâ€™re done making a series of code changes
- Prefer running single tests, and not the whole test suite, for performance

## KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

Simplicity should be a key goal in design. Choose straightforward solutions over complex ones whenever possible. Simple solutions are easier to understand, maintain, and debug.

## YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)

Avoid building functionality on speculation. Implement features only when they are needed, not when you anticipate they might be useful in the future.

## Testing Strategy

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

1. **Write the test first** - Define expected behavior before implementation
2. **Watch it fail** - Ensure the test actually tests something
3. **Write minimal code** - Just enough to make the test pass
4. **Refactor** - Improve code while keeping tests green
5. **Repeat** - One test at a time

## Git Workflow

### Branch Strategy

- `main` - Integration branch for features
- `release/*` - Production-ready code
- `feature/*` - New features
- `fix/*` - Bug fixes
- `docs/*` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/*` - Code refactoring
- `test/*` - Test additions or fixes

### Commit Message Format

Never include claude code, or written by claude code in commit messages

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```
Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore

Example:

```
feat(auth): add two-factor authentication

- Implement TOTP generation and validation
- Add QR code generation for authenticator apps
- Update user model with 2FA fields

Closes #123

```

## Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation

- Every module should have a docstring explaining its purpose
- Public functions must have complete docstrings
- Complex logic should have inline comments with `# Reason:` prefix
- Keep README.md updated with setup instructions and examples
- Maintain CHANGELOG.md for version history

## Security Best Practices

### Security Guidelines

- Never commit secrets - use environment variables
- Validate all user input
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Use HTTPS for all external communications
